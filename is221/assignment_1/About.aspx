        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Rudr Prasad  . I am a second year student studying bachelors of software enginerring at the University of the south pacific. From a young age ive always been fascinated by the world of computers, which naturally led me to software engineering. Growing up, i was always the kid that would break apart gadgets just to see how they worked. This curiosity led me to try my first programming langauge in highschool, which was python. This, together with my undying passion to hack the neighbours wifi led me to software engineering. Outside of school work, I like to play sports such as soccer and chess, the later being one of my favourite hobbies. Ive even represented my nation in several international tournaments.</p>

        <p>Hey everyone, my name is Rishal Prasad. I am a second year student studying Bachelors of Software Engineering at the University of the South pacific. I've always had a curiosity towards technology seeing how we have evolved from a simple wheel invention to having the technology to set foot on moon. This made it all the more plausible for me to see the science behind the new digital era we live in hence software. In my day to day events, i prefer a social night out when I'm not debugging.</p>
